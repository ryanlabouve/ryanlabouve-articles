<h1 id="being-effective-in-chaos">Being effective in chaos</h1>

<p>My day is a constant onslaught of requests, needs, conversations, and interuptions. I am not productive if I don’t plan carefully.</p>

<p>Hitting a <a href="http://ryanlabouve.com/productivity-in-chaos-i-zero-mind">0 state</a> is just the first step.</p>

<p>Here’s what I do next (note, this will be different for you):</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Create a scratch doc for the day</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Scan schedule and add meetings to scratch doc</p>

    <p>2b. Cancel every meeting you can</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Read quarterly plan for timelines / projects. (i.e. get perspetive on macro objectives).</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Add valuable notes / concerns to scratch doc</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Scan Pivotal to figure out what folks are working on and what’s coming next (i.e. get micro objectives)</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Add valuable notes / concerns to scratch doc</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Flag 3 things you must do today</p>

    <ul>
      <li>I have a running list in omnifocus with things I need to do.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="scratch-doc">Scratch Doc</h2>

<p>I hate showing up unpreparred. It wastes the time everyone’s time when I am unpreparred.</p>

<p>Haivng notes before stepping into any meeting is the easiest way to avoid this.</p>

<p><strong>The scratch doc</strong> is my manifest of the day. It’s notes for every plannign meeting. If I’m researching, it’s a running log of what I’ve tried. If I have a meeting, it has the prep notes and the notes I take from the meeting. It has links to any useful spreadsheet/PR/doc that I’ve used that day.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the end of every day I migrate my notes from <code>MarkdownEditor</code> to <code>NotesAsAService</code> in one large file. From this I can always reference old notes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="scratch-from-schedule">Scratch from Schedule</h2>

<p>After I do my 0’s, the next thing I do is walk through my calendar for the day, and make notes on every important meeting I have.</p>

<p>Here’s a few examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Interviews</strong> Preparing for interviews helps them go well. Collect all relevant docs in one place (e.g. resume, question bank). And take some time to review a candidate’s CV ahead of time and make notes. Then, during the interview you can also jot notes down.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Meetings</strong> Every meeting should have a purpose. If it doesn’t, instead of adding it to the scratch doc, cancel the meeting. Otherwise, log the purpose, all relevant links (e.g. specs, spreadsheets, etc) and take some notes about your current views on the subject and anything top of mind. Throughout the day, when you have ideas related to the meeting just add them to the scratch doc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>1:1’s</strong> Being preparred for a 1:1 is the an easy way to help your direct report feel respected, important, and heard. Look through what they’ve been assigned to do. Make notes on PR’s, tickets, etc. Don’t have them waste the time telling you what they’ve been doing.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

</blockquote>

<p>If an extra 15 or 30 minutes in mylap, I should instantly know what to work on. That’s the point of listing 3 prioritized actions on the scratch list.</p>

<p>Some caveats:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This take should be a well defined action. (i.e. “clear surfaces in kitcen” over “clean up”)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minimize the time build up context by adding relevant details by your actions. You don’t have to get religious about this, but just enough to drop you into flow asap.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
