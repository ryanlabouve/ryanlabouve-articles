<p>Distraction decends on your mind daily, stealing attention. If left unmitigated, you will have no control over what you accomplish.</p>
<p>My solution:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>zeros</em> before you start working</li>
<li>Don’t react to noise</li>
<li>Decide what matters before you start working</li>
</ol>
<p>Now your mind is clear. Every free moment that’s left in your day is a decsion for you to focus on what matter.</p>
<h2><a id="Focus_12"></a>Focus</h2>
<p>Focus is a key ingredient for impact. Let’s consider the physics of pressure.</p>

<p><em>~waves hands~</em> Productivity operates under a similar principle.</p>

<p>Worrying about too many things dilutes your focus. Focusing on less gives you greater capacity for impact.</p>
<p><strong>We can’t afford to start defeated.</strong></p>

<p>How tf can anyone focus with all of these tabs open? ☝️</p>
<p>Our inboxes, todolists, open programs, etc. are an expanding hostile army of distraction that we treat as a comfort blanket.</p>
<p>Every open and unread <em>thing</em>  is compounding cognitive debt. You will never look at these tabs again. You are organizing required information in a transient sea, you are building castles in the sand. Use a better system.</p>
<h2><a id="Start_everyday_with_your_0s_36"></a>Start everyday with your 0’s</h2>
<p>Start every day by closing everything. Here’s a little chart I use to guide my daily ritual:</p>
<p><img src="https://com-ryanlabouve-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/productivity/zeros.png" alt="https://com-ryanlabouve-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/productivity/zeros.png"></p>
<p>This is a forcing function. Save and organize that one word doc/spread sheet. And to close all those damn PDF books you are not going to read today.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Slack</strong>— No unread DM’s that you are saving. Convert that to a todo. CMD+T &amp; Enter to quicking go through unread conversations. If this is laboirous, you are in too many channels. Mute/leave some.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Browser</strong>— Close all the tabs. If there’s something potentially actionable to do from a tab that you are not closing, this means it needs to be a todo item.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Programs: Terminal/IDE, Docs, Scratch notes, open PDF’s</strong>— Close everything. Try to finish by completing your task (i.e. commit &amp; push). If you cannot, leave yourself notes about where to pickup in an actionable todo. Move sctach notes into something savable and searchable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Email</strong>— Every day your email should begin and end at inbox 0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Omnifocus</strong>— this is my final frountier. Where stuff goes to get done or get deleted. (feel free to substitue for your tool of choice)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The first time you “go to 0” it may take some time. That’s fine. It’s an investment.</p>
<p>Also, you will need some system to handle <em>the rest of getting things done</em>— sticky notes, GTD, bullet journals… whatever works for you.</p>
<p>Push through the table-steaks and focus on hard problems.</p>
