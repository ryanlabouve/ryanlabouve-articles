# Productivity In Chaos: Zero Mind

Distraction decends on your mind daily, stealing attention. If left unmitigated, you will have no control over what you accomplish.

My solution:

1.  _zeros_ before you start working
2.  Don't react to noise
3.  Decide what matters before you start working

Now your mind is clear. Every free moment that's left in your day is a decsion for you to focus on what matter.

## Focus

Focus is a key ingredient for impact. Let's consider the physics of pressure.

_~waves hands~_ Productivity operates under a similar principle.

Worrying about too many things dilutes your focus. Focusing on less gives you greater capacity for impact.

**We can't afford to start defeated.**

How tf can anyone focus with all of these tabs open? ☝️

Our inboxes, todolists, open programs, etc. are an expanding hostile army of distraction that we treat as a comfort blanket.

Every open and unread _thing_  is compounding cognitive debt. You will never look at these tabs again. You are organizing required information in a transient sea, you are building castles in the sand. Use a better system.

## Start everyday with your 0's

Start every day by closing everything. Here's a little chart I use to guide my daily ritual:

This is a forcing function. Save and organize that one word doc/spread sheet. And to close all those damn PDF books you are not going to read today.

* **Slack**— No unread DM's that you are saving. Convert that to a todo. CMD+T & Enter to quicking go through unread conversations. If this is laboirous, you are in too many channels. Mute/leave some.

* **Browser**— Close all the tabs. If there's something potentially actionable to do from a tab that you are not closing, this means it needs to be a todo item.

* **Programs: Terminal/IDE, Docs, Scratch notes, open PDF's**— Close everything. Try to finish by completing your task (i.e. commit & push). If you cannot, leave yourself notes about where to pickup in an actionable todo. Move sctach notes into something savable and searchable. 

* **Email**— Every day your email should begin and end at inbox 0.

* **Omnifocus**— this is my final frountier. Where stuff goes to get done or get deleted. (feel free to substitue for your tool of choice)

## A clear mind can handle chaos

The first time you "go to 0" it may take some time. That's fine. It's an investment. 

Also, you will need some system to handle _the rest of getting things done_— sticky notes, GTD, bullet journals... whatever works for you.

Push through the table-steaks and focus on hard problems.
