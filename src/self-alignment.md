# Self Alignment

> "First say to yourself what you will be; and then do what you have to do." —Epictetus

You are who you are.

We are surrounded by evidence of this. Look down. Look around. Your clothes. The mess of papers, books, and clothes on your floor. The half started project in the corner. The mess of icons on your phone screen in no particular order.

We are who we are. And it is up to use to be who we are suppoed to be.

Everything between who we are supposed to be and who we are is your responsibility to change. Or accpet. It's up to you.

## Acute vs Chronic realignment

## Rituals, routines, commitments

Decide what is important to you. Then live true to those as your pirorities.

> In AD 65, Seneca was caught up in the aftermath of the Pisonian conspiracy, a plot to kill Nero. Although it is unlikely that Seneca was part of the conspiracy, Nero ordered him to kill himself.[28] Seneca followed tradition by severing several veins in order to bleed to death, and his wife Pompeia Paulina attempted to share his fate. Cassius Dio, who wished to emphasize the relentlessness of Nero, focused on how Seneca had attended to his last-minute letters, and how his death was hastened by soldiers
