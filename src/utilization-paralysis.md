## Power up, Get Stuff Done, Power Down

New days dawn and chaos reacts pursues. There have been times when I sit down at my keyboard at 9am, react... respond... and don't emrge until 4pm, feeling like I've accomplished nothing.

Recipe to defend against chaos:

* Don't react
* Process, organize, and prioritize before you perform
* Focus on the right thing

### Pt 1. Power up, Power Down.

You are more productive when there are less things on your mind. My whole system resolves around facilitating focus.

Let's consider the pysics of pressuare.

Worrying about too many things dillutes your focus.

How tf can anyone focus with all of these things open? ☝️

And our inboxes, todolists, open programs, etc are an expanding wasteland of distraction that we treat as a comfort blanket.

If we are never able to close tabs it turns into cognative debt, continuing to compound daily. You will never look at these tabs again. In the RARE instance that you need to return to a tab, you probably can't find it. AND if you are organizing required information in a place transient, you are building castles in the sand.

## Daily Power Up & Power Down Routine

### Close every program

This forces you to save and organize that one word doc/spread sheet. And to close all those damn PDF books you are not going to read today. Everything that's open that you are not immediately using/focusing onis a distraction and needs to be dealt with.

* **Email**— Every day your email should begin and end at 0. If it's something quick, just address the email as fast as possible. If an email implies something you need to do, make a todo item.

* **Browser**— Close all the tabs. If there's something potentially actionable to do from a tab that you are not closing, this means it needs to be a todo item.

* **Slack**— No unread DM's that you are saving. Convert that to a todo. CMD+T & Enter to quicking go through unread conversations. If this is laboirous, you are in too many channels. Mute/leave some.

* **Terminal/IDE**— Close everything. Try to finish by completing your task (i.e. commit & push). If you cannot, leave yourself notes about where to pickup in an actionable todo.

      	If this is a product of it being painful to open all of your services and get things running, write a script to do this. Don't just open things by hand. Here's how I accomplish this in TMUX (link), but there's more than one way to skin a potato.

For me this is important because I'll keep 15 textedits open with little notes. These actually need to be TODO's in Omnifocus or proper notes in Evernote.

### Zero I0,0

* **Inbox 0**— This should be already done from the previous step.

* **Process the inbox of Omnifocus**— Every todo list item needs to be in the correct project (i.e. not the inbox) witht the correct context, deadline, and relevant details. If it's something you know you're not going to do, just delete it.

## Debugging your desire to horde tabs and things

Why can't you close things?

* _That one article I don't want to lose_, Answer: Todo list, Junk drawer, or most likey, just close it

* _The research I'm doing_, Answer: Word/evernote doc. Omnifocus task with link to doc with next actionable

* _These tabs are all the things I need to look at constantly_, Anwer: Bookmark folder that you can open all very easily.

## Why can't you delete things

* _Email/DM/notification that I can't forget_, Answer: Todo item. If this gives you heartburn it means you don't trust your system of getting things done.

* _That text doc/image/screenshot_, Answer: Evernote with description. Search for it when/if you need it. (Most of the time you won't).

At the end of every day, mark everything as read. Delete all your email. Close all your tabs. Take a deep breath. And go live

## Bankrupcy

If you are new to zeroing out your emails, notifications, etc it may require non-trivial amounts of time. I'd honestly suggest reading Getting Things Done (or watching a good TL;DR on YouTube).

1.  Close every tab. Convert to todo if you can't close
2.  Inbox 0 work email: Archive or convert every email to a todo
3.  Clean desktop

### Pt 2. Getting Stuff Done

**More things to do**

[time to build up context] => [time to focus on a solution]

vs.

[time to build up context] => [time to focus] => interuption... answer quick question => repay time to build up context => interuptoin, blocking task => build up context => [focusing] => find related problem => explore related problem] => build up context agian to orginial proble (like, why am I doing this)

My day is a constant onslaught of request, new needs, conversations. And this is great! BUT it's impossible to get things done if I am not very careful.

* Breaking tasks into small actionable chunks
* Minimize the time build up context
* Acknolwedge, Triage, ETA

## How to Ignore New Tasks

You need a funnel to shove new tasks through.

The goal is that you are confident that you can put a task in your pipeline and know that it will get done.

There are MANY oppinions of how to best implement this. So I'll go over the main things I'm looking for in a pipeline, show you what I do, and then you can decide how to organize.

Personally I use GTD (link).

* Intake
  _ Triage them: prioritize
  _ Get them done eventually
* Omnifocus Inbox: A place to put new things
* Omnifocus Projects: Organize related todos
* Omnifocus Contexts: A way to partition the type of work you are doing
