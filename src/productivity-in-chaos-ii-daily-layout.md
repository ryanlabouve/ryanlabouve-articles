# Efficacy in chaos: Layout your day

My day is a constant onslaught of request, new needs, conversations. And this is great! BUT it's impossible to get things done if I am not very careful.

Hitting a [0 state](#) is just the first step. 

Next:

1.  Start a scratch doc. This is your external harddrive for the day
2. Scan your schedule to determine twf you have to do
3. Flag 3 things you must do today

## Scratch Doc

As a manager, the last thing I want to do is show up for something unpreparred. I hate wasting the time of my engineers or collegues. My main method of ensuring that I don't waste their time is the scratch doc

**What it is—** The scratch doc is my manifest of the day. If I'm doing research, it's a running log of what I've tried. If I have a meeting, it's the prep notes and the notes I take from the meeting. It has links to any useful spreadsheet/PR/doc that I've used that day.

> At the end of every day I migrate my notes from `ByWord` to `Evernote` in one large file. From this I can always reference old notes.

## Scratch from Schedule

After I do my 0's, the next thing I do is walk through my calendar for the day, and make notes on every important meeting I have.

* **Interviews** Preparing for interviews helps them go well. Collect all relevant docs in one place (e.g. resume, question bank). And take some time to review a candidate's CV ahead of time and make notes. Then, during the interview you can also jot notes down.

* **Meetings** Every meeting should have a purpose. If it doesn't, instead of adding it to the scratch doc, cancel the meeting. Otherwise, log the purpose, all relevant links (e.g. specs, spreadsheets, etc) and take some notes about your current views on the subject and anything top of mind. Throughout the day, when you have ideas related to the meeting just add them to the scratch doc.

* **1:1's** My direct reports are the most important part of my job. As a manager my job is to work with others to facilitate changes for the company. I have much more to say about these, but being preparred for a 1:1 is the easiest way to help your direct report feel respected, important, and heard. Look through what they've been assigned to do. Make notes on PR's, tickets, etc. Don't have them waste the time telling you what they've been doing. 

## Then add your top 3 to Scratch

If I dropped an extra 15 or 30 minutes in your lap, you should instantly know what you want to work on. That's the glory of listing 3 prioritized actions on your scratch list.

* Breaking tasks into small actionable chunks when you log them

* Minimize the time build up context by adding relevant details by your actions. You don't have to get religious about this, but just enough to drop you into flow asap.

* Acknolwedge, Triage, and get back to work when things come up and you are engaged.
