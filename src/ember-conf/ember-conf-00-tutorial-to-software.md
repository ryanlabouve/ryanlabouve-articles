I owe an unfortunate amount of my career to the [Rails tutorial book by Michael Hartl](https://www.railstutorial.org/).

I read it one weekend and decided, armed with that knowledge, I could make any app out of Twitter!

This series is an homage to him, and to Ember.

## My history with Ember

## Super Rentals => Super Desk Rentals

We are going to take the app created in the Ember Guides and turn it into _actual software_.

We'll define this by two criteria:

1. Given randos visiting our site, we can turn them into users
2. Given users, we can take their money.

Let's layout our Journey.
