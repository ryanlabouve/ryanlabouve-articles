# To my kiddos: hard won lessons about life

Life is a totem composed of segments. Eternity, health, finances, family, work, and hobbies are each segments that build on each other to form your character.

It's important that you approach each one individually strong enough for everything else to rest upon. And in a way where they all build up to one beajutifl statue.

Here's how I recommend approaching each one, from bottom to top, with only the essential advice.

1.  Contemplate Eternity
2.  Optimize your health
3.  Control your finances
4.  Spend time with your family
5.  Set boundaries around work
6.  Have a hobby

These six things make the foundation of your life: "The Human Condition", health, finances, family, work, and hobbies.

## 1. Contemplate Eternity

This is a hard one to start with, but ultimately the most important.

[Memento Mori. A token by which to remember that we will die]

Eons have passed before you, and you were in darkenss. Eons will go beyond you, and you will be in darkness again. Conciousness is a strange and terrible gift.

[Flowers of the field]

This life is our canvas. We each have to find meaning in it. This alone trumps everything else. This alone should guide the cardinal direction of your life.

Everything else around us is an illusion of a world. Homelessness. Structure. Zombies.

Contemplate eterntity.

## 2. Optimize your health

> Nothing is worth anything if your too sick for it to matter. — Dad

## 3. Control your finances

You will always be stressed until you have 3-6 months in the bank and control of your monthly budget... with as little debt as possible.

## 4. Spend time with your family

I'm convinced that time is the function by which a family bonds. Blood is only blood.

## 5. Set boundaries around work

I will say this very bluntly: your job doesn't give two shits about you.

I've seen "people who are too valuable to fire" lose their jobs instantly. I've seen "I don't see how this place would run without bob" continue to run without Bob.

This is why it's very important to be intentional with the scope that you give work in your life.

I love working late. I love working hard. But I have also regretted working through certain periods of my life where work has effected my health (see Optimize Your Health).

* Do everything that matters before you start working
* Have time carved out for your family that is a minimum req
* Have a bed time

There will be exceptoins. But exceptions will always want to become the rule.

## 6. Have a hobby

Do stupid things.

# Conclusion

Build your life the best you can. As the stroms of life come against you, be confidency, follow your heart, be careful, and always always always be yourself.
