# To my kiddos: Life and you are a tower

> Something is important to you right now. Very important. Really doesn't matter.

> I mean it matters to you. But it doesn't matter for you. It doesn't _matter_.

The rise and fall of nations. Everything starts small. Fields. Then a wall. Brick by brick something emerges. Something large. Big. Too big to fall. Until it falls.

Rome. After conquering EVERY NATION, it was saced by a rabble of barbarians.

As we grow, we face larger and larger challenges. But we neglect the very foundations. The further we conquer, the more likely something small keeps us from reaching dominion.

The foundation of life is a tower— floors building each other to a building: Eternity, health, finances, family, work, and hobbies.

Approach each one individually and in order. Everything you do in life builds on these, whether you want to or not.

Failure in light of a strong tower is a lesson. Failure in your tower brings everything to ruin.

Here's how I recommend approaching each one.

1. _Contemplate_ Eternity
2. _Optimize_ your health
3. _Control_ your finances
4. _Spend time with_ your family
5. _Set boundaries_ around work
6. _Have_ a hobby

Each of these adjectives are the strongest tool I can reommend to give strength to your tower.

## 1. Contemplate Eternity

Eons have passed before you, and you were in darkenss. Eons will go beyond you, and you will be in darkness again. Conciousness is a strange and terrible gift.

Our story is a story, but it's up to each of us to decide what this means in the light of eternity.

[Memento Mori. A token by which to remember that we will die]

[Flowers of the field]

This life is our canvas. We each have to find meaning in it. This alone should guide the direction of your life.

Contemplate eterntity. This should be the start of your journey. As it will also be the end of your journey.

## 2. Optimize your health

> Nothing is worth anything if your too sick for it to matter. — Dad

There will be obstacles. You will be missing an arm or an eye. Things will break. There will be deficienties. Don't forcus on perfection. Take what you have and make it better. Control what you can. And then use what you have to overcome the rest.

- _Don't be obese_ — This is chronically bad. And it's something you can control.
- _Be strong (in your own way)_ —
- _Don't be afraid to challenge your body, just don't ruin it_ —

## 3. Control your finances

> We cannot give freely of ourselves when we are inbedted to others. —Mark Allan

You will always be stressed until you have 3-6 months in the bank and control of your monthly budget. Some view this as a nusiance or a chore to be put off. But this is a duty. Your budget it more important most other things. Get it right. Use it to navigate your life.

- Income is a stream, but your financies should be a body of water.
- Spend some, save some, give some
- Debt is categorically dumb. If you get in it, getting out of it is your top prioirty. Interest is when you pay rent on money.
- Play the long game with finances. Build assets. Limit liabilities.
- Live off of money you have (and proove this with a budget)

## 4. Spend time with your family

I'm convinced that time is the function by which a family bonds. Blood is only blood. Share aventure and you will be close forever.

## 5. Set boundaries around work

I will say this very bluntly: your job doesn't give two shits about you.

I've seen "people who are too valuable to fire" lose their jobs instantly. I've seen "I don't see how this place would run without 'Me'" continue to run without.

This is why it's very important to be intentional with the scope that you give work in your life.

I love working late. I love working hard. But I have also regretted working through certain periods of my life where work has effected my health (see Optimize Your Health).

- Do everything that matters before you start working
- Have time carved out for your family that is a minimum req
- Have a bed time

There will be exceptions. But exceptions will always want to become the rule.

## 6. Have a hobby

Do stupid things.

# Conclusion

Build your life the best you can. As the stroms of life come against you, be confidency, follow your heart, be careful, and always always always be yourself.

The tower is at the beggining and the end of our life. It's not the purpose. But I guess it is. We have to be prepared for the journey of life. This is only a beginning. And eventually the only thing you'll have left. Good luck.
