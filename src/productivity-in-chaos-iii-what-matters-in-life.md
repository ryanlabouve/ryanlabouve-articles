## Efficacy in chaos: What matters in life

Days are units not sufficient. But they are the only way we have to move towards our big goals.

Productivity doesn't matter if your life is empty and meaningless.

Don't work for the end of the month.

## Your System, How to Ignore New Tasks

> “THE PURPOSE OF this whole method of workflow management is not to let your brain become lax, but rather to enable it to move toward more elegant and productive activity. In order to earn that freedom, however, your brain must engage on some consistent basis with all your commitments and activities. You must be assured that you’re doing what you need to be doing, and that it’s OK to be not doing what you’re not doing.” — David Allen

> “Everything you’ve told yourself you ought to do, your mind thinks you should do right now. Frankly, as soon add you have two things to do stored in your RAM, you’ve generated personal failure, because you can’t do two things at the same time. This produces an all-pervasive stress factor whose source can’t be pin-pointed.” — David Allen

> “(1) collect things that command our attention; (2) process what they mean and what to do about them; and (3) organize the results, which we (4) review as options for what we choose to (5) do.” — David Allen

You need a funnel to shove new tasks through.

The goal is that you are confident that you can put a task in your pipeline and know that it will get done.

There are MANY oppinions of how to best implement this. So I'll go over the main things I'm looking for in a pipeline, show you what I do, and then you can decide how to organize.

Personally I use [Getting Things Done](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1547510993&sr=8-2&keywords=getting+things+done).

* Intake
  _ Triage them: prioritize
  _ Get them done eventually
* Omnifocus Inbox: A place to put new things
* Omnifocus Projects: Organize related todos
* Omnifocus Contexts: A way to partition the type of work you are doing

### Process the inbox of Omnifocus, daily

Every todo list item needs to be in the correct project (i.e. not the inbox) witht the correct context, deadline, and relevant details. If it's something you know you're not going to do, just delete it.

**Work out of your buckets**

### Setting your priorities for the day

What's top of mind? What's due soon? What else is in your bucket?

From Warren Buffet to Rachael Hollis.

Even if you have to do a lot of _stuff_, only focus on the most important things

Step one to doing that is knowing, at all times, what the most important things are

If I dropped an extra 15 or 30 minutes in your lap, you should instantly know what you want to work on.

For me, as I mentioned before, I have these general buckets:

* work
* home
* side-projects
* consume
* Ticklr

## Bankrupcy

If you are new to zeroing out your emails, notifications, etc it may require non-trivial amounts of time. I'd honestly suggest reading Getting Things Done (or watching a good TL;DR on YouTube).

1.  Close every tab. Convert to todo if you can't close
2.  Inbox 0 work email: Archive or convert every email to a todo
3.  Clean desktop

### Pt 2. Getting Stuff Done

**More things to do**

Diagram

[time to build up context] => [time to focus on a solution]

vs.

[time to build up context] => [time to focus] => interuption... answer quick question => repay time to build up context => interuptoin, blocking task => build up context => [focusing] => find related problem => explore related problem] => build up context agian to orginial proble (like, why am I doing this)

My day is a constant onslaught of request, new needs, conversations. And this is great! BUT it's impossible to get things done if I am not very careful.

* Breaking tasks into small actionable chunks
* Minimize the time build up context
